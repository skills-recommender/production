what is CRED?




CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.




here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.




here’s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a part of the team




what will you do:




working on a disruptive product that’s still in its early stages
review functional and design specifications to ensure a complete understanding of the system.
taking ownership of the end-to-end system and taking all requirements, issues, and enhancements to closure single-handedly.
develop and maintain the automation framework and scripts for regression and continuous integration
mentoring other engineers, defining our technical culture, and helping to build a fast-growing team.




you should apply If you are:




possess 1-6 years of experience as a software development engineer in test.
have mobile testing experience with strong basics, understand about the mobile os and excellent debugging skills.
have prior experience in creating optimal test strategy (including functional, non functional, analytics and automation) and test plans for short term and long term projects both.
have strong hands on experience on functional and non functional testing of mobile applications (both ios and android)
have prior experience in creating test automation frameworks and self serve tools.
have experience in mobile automation (android & ios) using espresso, xcuitest and appium.
have experience in Java with strong base in object-oriented design and development.
experience with relational databases and sql queries
have the ability to handle the independent execution with minimal guidance
have experience in project management tools like jira, rallydev, fogbugz.
have sharp analytical abilities, proven design skills, excellent communication skills.







how is life at CRED?




working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.




hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance.




to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game.




there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch.","['Jira', 'Test Automation', 'Appium', 'Functional Testing', 'Java', 'Mobile Testing', 'Object Oriented Design', 'SQL', 'Test Planning', 'Test Strategy']"

203,Technical Lead,Thales," Bengaluru, Karnataka, India ","About the job
Location: Bangalore, India

Thales people architect solutions that enable two-thirds of planes to take off and land safely. We create in-flight entertainment systems that engross 50 million fliers every year and we develop the avionics that control the world’s largest commercial aircrafts. Our simulators train the next generation of pilots for fighter jets, transporters and search and rescue helicopters. And, together, each and every member of our aerospace team makes a difference.

Thales is expanding its presence in India through the development a Group Engineering Competence Centre (ECC), reinforcing its position as a leader in all its markets. Launching in early 2019 in Bengaluru, the ECC will expand Thales’ footprint in its core business areas and cement its long-standing relationship with India. This ECC, the first of its kind in India, will focus on hardware, software and systems engineering capabilities for both the civil and defence sectors. India, and in particular Bengaluru, was chosen as the location for the new ECC due to the existing ecosystem – its proximity to the market, competence in research and development and abundance of skilled engineers.

The culture

We believe in constantly iterating and improving our team culture, just like our product. We have found a good balance between async and sync work — default is still Notion docs over meetings, but at the same time, we recognize that as an early-stage startup brainstorming together over calls leads to results faster. If you enjoy taking ownership, moving quickly, and writing docs, you will fit right in.




The role:

Our engineering team is growing and we are looking to bring on board a senior software engineer who can help us transition to the next phase of the company.

Author high-quality, highly-performance, and unit-tested code running on a distributed environment using containers.
Continually evaluate and improve DevOps processes for a cloud-native codebase.
Review PRs, mentor others and proactively take initiatives to improve our team's shipping velocity.
Leverage your industry experience to champion engineering best practices within the organization.




Qualifications

Work Experience

5+ years of industry experience (3+ years in a senior engineering role) preferably with some exposure in leading remote development teams in the past.
Proven track record building large-scale, high-throughput, low-latency production systems with at least 3+ years working with customers, architecting solutions, and delivering end-to-end products.
Fluency in writing production-grade Go or Python in a microservice architecture with containers/VMs for over 5+ years.
2+ years of DevOps experience (Kubernetes, Docker, Helm and public cloud APIs)
Worked with relational (SQL) as well as non-relational databases (Mongo or Couch) in a production environment.
(Bonus: worked with big data in data lakes/warehouses).
(Bonus: built an end-to-end ML pipeline)

Skills

Strong documentation skills. As a remote team, we heavily rely on elaborate documentation for everything we are working on.
Ability to motivate, mentor, and lead others (we have a flat team structure, but the team would rely upon you to make important decisions)
Strong independent contributor as well as a team player.
Working knowledge of ML and familiarity with concepts of MLOps

Benefits

Competitive Salary 💸
Work Remotely 🌎

The culture

We believe in constantly iterating and improving our team culture, just like our product. We have found a good balance between async and sync work — default is still Notion docs over meetings, but at the same time, we recognize that as an early-stage startup brainstorming together over calls leads to results faster. If you enjoy taking ownership, moving quickly, and writing docs, you will fit right in.




The role:

Our engineering team is growing and we are looking to bring on board a senior software engineer who can help us transition to the next phase of the company. As we roll out our platform to customers, you will be pivotal in refining our system architecture, ensuring the various tech stacks play well with each other, and smoothening the DevOps process.

By joining our team, you will get the exposure to working across a swath of modern technologies while building an enterprise-grade ML platform in the most promising area.




Responsibilities

Be the bridge between engineering and product teams. Understand long-term product roadmap and architect a system design that will scale with our plans.
Take ownership of converting product insights into detailed engineering requirements. Break these down into smaller tasks and work with the team to plan and execute sprints.
Author high-quality, highly-performance, and unit-tested code running on a distributed environment using containers.
Continually evaluate and improve DevOps processes for a cloud-native codebase.
Review PRs, mentor others and proactively take initiatives to improve our team's shipping velocity.
Leverage your industry experience to champion engineering best practices within the organization.




Qualifications

Work Experience

5+ years of industry experience (3+ years in a senior engineering role) preferably with some exposure in leading remote development teams in the past.
Proven track record building large-scale, high-throughput, low-latency production systems with at least 3+ years working with customers, architecting solutions, and delivering end-to-end products.
Fluency in writing production-grade Go or Python in a microservice architecture with containers/VMs for over 5+ years.
2+ years of DevOps experience (Kubernetes, Docker, Helm and public cloud APIs)
Worked with relational (SQL) as well as non-relational databases (Mongo or Couch) in a production environment.
(Bonus: worked with big data in data lakes/warehouses).
(Bonus: built an end-to-end ML pipeline)

Skills

Strong documentation skills. As a remote team, we heavily rely on elaborate documentation for everything we are working on.
Ability to motivate, mentor, and lead others (we have a flat team structure, but the team would rely upon you to make important decisions)
Strong independent contributor as well as a team player.
Working knowledge of ML and familiarity with concepts of MLOps

Benefits

Competitive Salary 💸
Work Remotely 🌎
Health insurance 🏥
Unlimited Time Off ⏰
Support for continual learning (free books and online courses) 📚
Reimbursement for streaming services (think Netflix) 🎥
Reimbursement for gym or physical activity of your choice 🏋🏽‍♀️
Flex hours 💪
Leveling Up Opportunities 🌱




You will excel in this role if

You have a product mindset. You understand, care about, and can relate to our customers.
You take ownership, collaborate, and follow through to the very end.
You love solving difficult problems, stand your ground, and get what you want from engineers.
Resonate with our core values of innovation, curiosity, accountability, trust, fun, and social good.","['Software Development', 'Data Lakes', 'DevOps', 'Employee Benefits', 'Go (Programming Language)', 'Helm (Software)', 'Kubernetes', 'MLOps', 'Microservices', 'Notion Productivity Software']"

what is CRED?




CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.




here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.




here’s what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a part of the team




what will you do:




working on a disruptive product that’s still in its early stages
review functional and design specifications to ensure a complete understanding of the system.
taking ownership of the end-to-end system and taking all requirements, issues, and enhancements to closure single-handedly.
develop and maintain the automation framework and scripts for regression and continuous integration
mentoring other engineers, defining our technical culture, and helping to build a fast-growing team.




you should apply If you are:




possess 1-6 years of experience as a software development engineer in test.
have mobile testing experience with strong basics, understand about the mobile os and excellent debugging skills.
have prior experience in creating optimal test strategy (including functional, non functional, analytics and automation) and test plans for short term and long term projects both.
have strong hands on experience on functional and non functional testing of mobile applications (both ios and android)
have prior experience in creating test automation frameworks and self serve tools.
have experience in mobile automation (android & ios) using espresso, xcuitest and appium.
have experience in Java with strong base in object-oriented design and development.
experience with relational databases and sql queries
have the ability to handle the independent execution with minimal guidance
have experience in project management tools like jira, rallydev, fogbugz.
have sharp analytical abilities, proven design skills, excellent communication skills.







how is life at CRED?




working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.




hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance.




to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game.




there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that’s for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch.","['Jira', 'Test Automation', 'Appium', 'Functional Testing', 'Java', 'Mobile Testing', 'Object Oriented Design', 'SQL', 'Test Planning', 'Test Strategy']"
