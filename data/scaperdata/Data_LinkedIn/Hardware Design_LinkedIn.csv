ARM crafts the technology that is at the heart of sophisticated digital products, from wireless, networking and consumer entertainment solutions to imaging, automotive, security and storage devices. ARM improves people’s lives by enabling the intelligence in affordable, easy-to-use electronic products that transform the way we live and work. We work in partnership with a global network of leading technology companies which are using our low-power technology. Together we are crafting the future of a better world.




ARM’s CPU group develops high performance CPU cores that drives many of today’s digital devices. Customers demand high quality and reliable IP, as the cost of design iterations is very high and shorter design cycles means that re-spins can be disastrous for the success of a product. Against this background, ARM has adopted a 'right-first-time' methodology and recognizes the need for dedicated verification engineers to work with the design team. Verification of ARM CPUs is a tough challenge!! At ARM, several complementary methodologies are used to ensure that no bugs go undetected. ARM CPU Verification Engineers have and develop specialist skills and knowledge and apply both hardware and software skills to the validation task.

Job Description Introduction




ARM crafts the technology that is at the heart of sophisticated digital products, from wireless, networking and consumer entertainment solutions to imaging, automotive, security and storage devices. ARM improves people’s lives by enabling the intelligence in affordable, easy-to-use electronic products that transform the way we live and work. We work in partnership with a global network of leading technology companies which are using our low-power technology. Together we are crafting the future of a better world.




ARM’s CPU group develops high performance CPU cores that drives many of today’s digital devices. Customers demand high quality and reliable IP, as the cost of design iterations is very high and shorter design cycles means that re-spins can be disastrous for the success of a product. Against this background, ARM has adopted a 'right-first-time' methodology and recognizes the need for dedicated verification engineers to work with the design team. Verification of ARM CPUs is a tough challenge!! At ARM, several complementary methodologies are used to ensure that no bugs go undetected. ARM CPU Verification Engineers have and develop specialist skills and knowledge and apply both hardware and software skills to the validation task. They work closely with the designers to understand various areas of the design, so that the features are thoroughly validated. This requires an insight both of the 'big picture' at the architectural level and of the detail at the implementation level.

Engineering at Arm




You know us. With 125 Arm-powered products shipped every second, we'll be in over a trillion smart devices by 2035. Your smartphone, award-winning VR gaming, the world's fastest supercomputer – our engineers are designing the advanced core processors leading the race towards a connected, autonomous, hyper-performance future.




So, we promise you endless opportunities to experiment and go even further in hardware!




Job Description Introduction




ARM’s Systems group develops Systems for internal and external use with all Arm IPs (like CPU, GPU, Interconnect, Memory controller, System MMU, FuSa IPs, etc) that drives many of today’s digital devices.




Customers demand high quality and reliable IP, as the cost of design iterations is very high and shorter design cycles means that re-spins can be disastrous for the success of a product. Against this background, Arm has adopted a 'right-first-time' methodology and recognizes the need for dedicated verification engineers to work with the various IP design teams.




As an Engineer in the Systems team, you will get the opportunity to work in and lead a small team of motivated engineers and continually develop specialist system skills and apply both hardware and software knowledge that come with these skills, to do their verification tasks.




Accountability




Develop systems (aka kits) that include Arm processors, interconnects, and peripherals.
Responsible for debugging hardware-software failures using simulation and emulation platform. This requires detailed understanding of System and Arm processor architecture
Proactively learning the latest Arm technology/protocols and keeping up to date with the progress on the new technologies.
Strong and continuous communication, as most of the team are cross site, in terms of planning, reviews, project tracking, continuous engagement through status updates and meetings, as well as delivery against expectation
Deliver on the engineering commitments successfully
Actively review inter-project dependencies and risks, assist in the resolution of differences where vital, to achieve greater success.
Drive efficiency improvement through adoption of right verification tools and methodologies
Required Education




A good university degree in electronics, computers, or equivalent with 5-8 years of experience at System level in one or many of the following areas such as Architecture, design, verification, integration, Software, validation




Essential Experience




Understanding of CPU and/or SoC architecture
Deep understanding of digital design concepts and Verilog/VHDL coding
Good in logical programming using C/C++/Assembly
Understanding of random verification methodologies including test generation tools, HVLs, coverage, etc
Knowledge about HW acceleration technology like Emulation and FPGA
Flair for problem solving and debugging
Proven track record of execution and/or methodology development and deployment on complex projects, individually or in a team
Good interpersonal and communication skills
Desirable Experience




Awareness of CPU/System architecture features (such as caches, MMU, SMP, coherency, pipelines)
Exposure to various market segments like Client, Infrastructure, Embedded, IoT
General understanding of Arm-based Systems and protocols like AHB, AXI, ACE, or CHI
Use of scripting languages like Perl/Python/Shell
Hands-on experience on HW acceleration platforms like Emulation and FPGA
Knowledge of advance verification techniques like assertions, property checking, etc.
